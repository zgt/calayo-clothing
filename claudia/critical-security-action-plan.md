## ðŸš¨ Critical Vulnerabilities Action Plan

### 1. CRITICAL: Admin ID Exposure in Client-Side Code

**Current Risk Level:** CRITICAL  
**Impact:** Complete administrative access compromise  
**Estimated Time:** 2-3 hours

#### Immediate Actions:
1. **Audit all admin ID references** (30 minutes)
   - [ ] Search codebase for all `NEXT_PUBLIC_ADMIN_ID` usage
   - [ ] Document every file that references admin credentials
   - [ ] Map client-side vs server-side usage

2. **Fix environment variable exposure** (90 minutes)
   - [ ] Update `src/app/admin/orders/[id]/page.tsx` line 97
   - [ ] Update `src/server/uploadthing.ts` line 24
   - [ ] Replace `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_ADMIN_ID` with `process.env.ADMIN_ID`
   - [ ] Move admin checks to server-side only

3. **Update environment configuration** (30 minutes)
   - [ ] Remove `NEXT_PUBLIC_ADMIN_ID` from `.env.local`
   - [ ] Ensure `ADMIN_ID` is server-side only
   - [ ] Update `src/env.js` to validate proper separation

4. **Immediate verification** (30 minutes)
   - [ ] Test admin functionality still works
   - [ ] Verify admin ID no longer appears in client bundle
   - [ ] Check browser dev tools for exposed credentials

     - `src/app/api/instagram/fetchChildrenIds.ts`
     - `src/app/api/instagram/fetchChildrenMedia.ts`
     - `src/app/api/instagram/fetchMedia.ts`
   - [ ] Replace `NEXT_PUBLIC_INSTA_ACCESS_TOKEN` with `INSTA_ACCESS_TOKEN`
   - [ ] Replace `NEXT_PUBLIC_INSTA_USER_ID` with `INSTA_USER_ID`

2. **Update environment variables** (30 minutes)
   - [ ] Remove `NEXT_PUBLIC_INSTA_*` from `.env.local`
   - [ ] Add server-side only `INSTA_ACCESS_TOKEN` and `INSTA_USER_ID`
   - [ ] Update `src/env.js` schema validation

3. **Regenerate Instagram tokens** (60 minutes)
   - [ ] Generate new Instagram access tokens
   - [ ] Test Instagram API functionality
   - [ ] Verify old tokens are revoked

4. **Verification** (30 minutes)
   - [ ] Confirm Instagram credentials not in client bundle

**Estimated Time:** 1-2 hours

#### Immediate Actions:
1. **Standardize admin ID usage** (90 minutes)
   - [ ] Update `src/app/admin/orders/[id]/page.tsx` to use `ADMIN_ID`
   - [ ] Verify `src/server/api/trpc.ts` uses `ADMIN_ID`
   - [ ] Verify `src/app/admin/orders/page.tsx` uses `ADMIN_ID`
   - [ ] Search for any other admin ID references

2. **Test admin authorization** (30 minutes)
   - [ ] Test admin login flows
   - [ ] Verify admin-only routes are protected
   - [ ] Test unauthorized access attempts

---

### 4. CRITICAL: Missing Environment Variable Validation

**Current Risk Level:** CRITICAL  
**Impact:** Security configuration bypass  
**Estimated Time:** 1 hour

#### Immediate Actions:
1. **Update environment schema** (45 minutes)
   - [ ] Update `src/env.js` to properly validate server-side credentials
   - [ ] Add validation for `ADMIN_ID` (server-side only)
   - [ ] Add validation for `INSTA_ACCESS_TOKEN` and `INSTA_USER_ID` (server-side only)
   - [ ] Remove client-side validation for sensitive credentials

2. **Test environment validation** (15 minutes)
   - [ ] Test application startup with new schema
   - [ ] Verify environment validation catches misconfigurations

---

### 5. CRITICAL: Lack of Rate Limiting on Instagram API

**Current Risk Level:** CRITICAL  
**Impact:** API quota exhaustion, service disruption  
**Estimated Time:** 2-3 hours

#### Immediate Actions:
1. **Implement basic rate limiting** (2 hours)
   - [ ] Add rate limiting middleware to Instagram sync endpoint
   - [ ] Set reasonable limits (e.g., 10 requests per minute)
   - [ ] Add request queuing for bulk operations
   - [ ] Update `src/server/api/routers/instagram.ts` lines 136-427

2. **Add monitoring** (30 minutes)
   - [ ] Log rate limit violations
   - [ ] Add basic metrics for API usage
   - [ ] Set up alerts for quota approaching

3. **Test rate limiting** (30 minutes)
   - [ ] Test normal Instagram sync operations
   - [ ] Verify rate limits are enforced
   - [ ] Test bulk operations don't exceed limits

---

### 6. CRITICAL: Unsafe File Uploads Without Validation

**Current Risk Level:** CRITICAL  
**Impact:** Malicious file uploads, storage attacks  
**Estimated Time:** 2-3 hours

#### Immediate Actions:
1. **Add file validation** (2 hours)
   - [ ] Update `src/server/uploadthing.ts` to add file type validation
